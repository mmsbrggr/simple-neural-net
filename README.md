## Motivation
This repository contains a straightforward implementation of a neural net with the
cabability of feeding data forward through the net and learning from data with the backpropagation algorithm.
The implementation is of course not able to compete with cutting edge neural net frameworks.
The project was a result of the author trying to better understand neural networks and implementing the basic
algorithms for educational purposes.

## Requirements
The main requirement is python 3. For using the neural net class the following packages are needed:
* numpy
